This code is part of an AI learning project.

Description:
This code implements a machine learning algorithm for classification. It uses a dataset of labeled examples to train a model, which can then be used to predict the class labels of new, unseen examples. The algorithm used in this code is [insert algorithm name].

Usage:
To use this code, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. Then, provide a labeled dataset in the appropriate format and run the code. The trained model will be saved to disk for future use.

Note:
This code is for educational purposes only and may not be suitable for production use. It is meant to demonstrate the implementation of a machine learning algorithm and should be used as a starting point for further development and experimentation.
